## Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup Design

Identifying design properties such as color styles and typography in a mockup is essential for ensuring visual consistency, brand alignment, and a cohesive user experience. These properties serve as the foundation for the application's look and feel, guiding developers and designers in implementing the interface accurately. Clear documentation of design properties helps maintain uniformity across all pages and components, reduces ambiguity during development, and streamlines collaboration between team members. Ultimately, it ensures that the final product matches the intended vision and delivers a professional, user-friendly experience.

## Importance of a User-Friendly Design in a Booking System

A user-friendly design is crucial in a booking system because it directly impacts user satisfaction, trust, and conversion rates. An intuitive interface reduces friction, making it easy for users to find properties, understand details, and complete bookings without confusion or frustration. Clear navigation, accessible features, and responsive layouts ensure that all users—including those on mobile devices or with disabilities—can successfully use the platform. Ultimately, a well-designed UI/UX builds confidence, encourages repeat usage, and minimizes errors or abandoned bookings, which are essential for the success of any booking platform.
